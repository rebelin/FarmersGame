AP Computer Science HW: Boolean Practice

A simulation of the classic Farmer's Game

Gameplay
--------

The goal of the game is to move all of the characters (the farmer, wolf, sheep, and cabbage) from one bank of the river to the other. The farmer is the only character who can row the boat, and he can only share his boat with one other character.
- Be careful. If the wolf and sheep are left alone, the wolf will eat the sheep. If the sheep and cabbage are left alone, the sheep will eat the cabbage.
